Your very own Pok√©mon legend is about to unfold! A world of dreams and adventures with Pok√©mon awaits! Let's go!"

‚Äî Professor Oak, 1998

## We're going to build a Pok√©dex!

Professor Oak wants to bring his Pok√©dex into the 21st century with a modern API-Driven Mobile-First React App, and has chosen Clique Studios to make it happen.

We're going to start this project out with Front-end (you), and then pass it off to backend next month to connect to the API.

### Designs

This is going to be a ***mobile-first*** project ‚Äî you can build out your designs for desktop later if you have time, but we're only targeting phones for the official challenge.  For this project we have a sample Figma design you can work off of, but if you'd like you can spend up to 30 minutes to research and explore alternate designs online (there's a bunch, but most of them aren't free Figma files).  

The sample Figma file isn't an exact 1:1 match to the requirements below, and you'll need to use your best judgement on how to modify it to fit the scope of the project.  

To get started with the [sample design](https://www.figma.com/community/file/979132880663340794), visit the link below, log into Figma, and click 'duplicate' to open it up in Figma.

# Sample API Data

For this project, the client has provided sample API responses for you to work with inside the `samples` folder. They've already been pre-imported into templates as JavaScript objects (so you won't be fetching live APIs with this project, we'll leave that to the backend devs).  

- pokemon.json - a list of the first 151 Pokemon
- eevee.json - Sample data for an individual Pokemon

In the starter files, there are API routes where you can access the APIs in your browser (FireFox is good for exploring API endpoints).  `/api/eevee` for the single Pok√©mon, or `/api/pokemon` for the list of pokemon.

# Starting Code

Please use this repo as a starter for this project, and commit to a branch using your name. (Sorry for the sloppiness, kiddo didn't want to let me clean it up this morning).

# Goals

***This challenge is for the front-end components and styles only***, and the deliverable will be a handoff to backend.  Feel free to import any static images you'd like into the `/public/images` folder for now (otters, kitties, and puppies are also acceptable placeholders if you'd like ü¶¶) ‚Äî backend will handle pulling the images from the API itself.

- Using Next.js (or a react framework of your choice), create the following views/pages:
    - Start / Home page
        - Should contain a search field in either the homepage or in the nav - your call
        - List of the user's favorite Pok√©mon (up to 6 cards)
    - Search Results page
        - Add state for the total results returned, and have that dynamically display
    - Individual Pokemon page
        - There's a lot of info you could display from the json, but at a minimum we want the name of the pokemon, a picture of the pokemon,  and the description
    - 404 page
- Use [next link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link) `<Link/>` component to link between pages, and the built-in [Next Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) `<Image/>` component for images.  We might have backend devs us a CDN with this next month. üòà
- When it makes sense, break complex bits of react into their own components (like maybe the search results cards).
- Push up your repo to bitbucket when finished and...
- Have fun!

## Bonus Goals:

- For each page/component, try to use CSS modules where it makes sense instead of global styles
- In search results, add a clickable heart icon to each returned Pok√©mon to allow the user to favorite the Pok√©mon.  Pass a user's favorite Pok√©mon to state.
- Deploy to a server of your choice (Vercel?)
- If you finish early, start a new branch called `(yourname)-backend` and try to work with the live api ([https://pokeapi.co/](https://pokeapi.co/))

# What's Next

We're going to take at least one final front-end from this month's challenge, and pass it off to the backend devs next month to build out the search functionality and wire it up as an app.

# Original Next.js Readme:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
